      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <div class="text-column">
          <p>Teddy's Treasures was founded in 2020 by Polina Maximenko, a passionate dog lover and textile designer from Winnipeg, Manitoba.</p>
          
          <p>The idea came to life when Polina was searching for beautiful, high-quality accessories for her beloved Bichon Frise, Teddy. Unable to find products that matched both Teddy's comfort needs and her own aesthetic standards, she decided to create her own.</p>
          
          <p>What started as handmade collars and harnesses for Teddy quickly grew into a small business as friends and family began requesting custom pieces for their own pets. Today, Teddy's Treasures has grown to a team of six dedicated craftspeople, all committed to creating premium accessories that combine functionality, comfort, and style.</p>
